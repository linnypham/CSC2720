structure: data representation in memory

base address: where the structure begin

specific index access

find a value in array with index
Base address + (data type memory cost)*i

quicksort 
O(n^2)(worst case)
O(nlogn)(avg case)

maxValue with queue
max q enque(i)
while i > tail element of max Q:
	remove from tail of maxq
enque i to the max q

deque(i)
if mainQ(front)==maxQ(front)
    remove from bot Qs
else:
    remove from mainQ

  harsh collision: whey harsh keys evaluate to the same value

classes:
    algorithm
    plc

Null is a subset of a tree

tree height balance, if the different in the height between the left subtree and right subtree
is no more than 1 for each and every node
