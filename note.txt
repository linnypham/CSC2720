structure: data representation in memory

base address: where the structure begin

specific index access

find a value in array with index
Base address + (data type memory cost)*i

quicksort 
O(n^2)(worst case)
O(nlogn)(avg case)

maxValue with queue
max q enque(i)
while i > tail element of max Q:
	remove from tail of maxq
enque i to the max q

deque(i)
if mainQ(front)==maxQ(front)
    remove from bot Qs
else:
    remove from mainQ

  harsh collision: whey harsh keys evaluate to the same value

classes:
    algorithm
    plc

Null is a subset of a tree

tree height balance, if the different in the height between the left subtree and right subtree
is no more than 1 for each and every node

pre order
    process node
    visit lst
    visit rst
in order
    visit lst
    process node
    visit rst
post order
    visit lst
    visit rst
    process node
level order
    level by level

call stack:
binary tree: at most 2 child nodes
binary search tree properties:
    1) Node level:
    left child node <= root
    right child node > root
    2)Sub tree level:
    property 1 is recursively applied to all subtrees

    time expected(high balance): O(logn)
    worse case time: O(n)

garbage collector: mark and sweep

delete value of root: lowest value of the right subtree
